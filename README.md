*	Visual Studio 2012, 2010, 2008, and 2005 PayPal Core SDK Class Libraries - C#.NET
*	Visual Studio Test 2012, 2010, 2008, and 2005 - C#.NET
*	NUnit Test only for Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition users - C#.NET


Prerequisites
-------------
*	Visual Studio 2005 or higher
*	NUnit  2.6.2 only for Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition users
*	log4net 1.2.10
*	NuGet 2.2 or higher for NuGet Installation of log4net [Note: NuGet 2.2 requires .NET Framework 4.0 or higher]


The PayPal Core SDK for .NET
----------------------------
*	The PayPal Core SDK is used to call the PayPal Platform API Web Service for the given payload and PayPal API profile settings

*	The PayPal Core SDK addresses the essential needs of the PayPal API caller:
 	Frequent and up-to-date releases: The PayPal Core SDK is available on NuGet, which translates as immediate SDK refreshes upon updates to PayPal APIs
 	Simpler configuration: A single configuration file that lets you manage your API credentials (supports multiple credentials), connectivity details, and service endpoints
 	Error log: The PayPal Core SDK uses the log4net tool to log output statements to a text file to help locate the problem
 	Backward compatibility: The PayPal Core SDK is developed using .NET Framework 2.0 and should compile on later versions of the .NET Framework

## OpenId Connect Integration

   * Redirect your buyer to obtain authorization
   * Capture the authorization code that is available as a query parameter ("code") in the redirect url
   * Exchange the authorization code for an access token, refresh token, id token combo
	
    Dictionary<string, string> configurationMap = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    configurationMap.Add("clientId", "...");
    configurationMap.Add("clientSecret", "...");
    configurationMap.Add("mode", "live");
    APIContext apiContext = new APIContext();
    apiContext.Config = configurationMap;

    ...
    
    CreateFromAuthorizationCodeParameters codeParams = new CreateFromAuthorizationCodeParameters();
    codeParams.SetCode("code");
    TokenInfo token = TokenInfo.CreateFromAuthorizationCode(apiContext, codeParams);
    string accessToken = token.access_token;

   * The access token is valid for a predefined duration and can be used for seamless XO or for retrieving user information

    ...

    TokenInfo infoToken = new TokenInfo();
    infoToken.refresh_token = "refreshToken";
    UserInfoParameters infoUserParams = new UserInfoParameters();
    infoUserParams.SetAccessToken(infoToken.access_token);
    UserInfo infoUser = UserInfo.GetUserInfo(apiContext, infoUserParams);

   * If the access token has expired, you can obtain a new access token using the refresh token from the 3'rd step

    ...
    
    CreateFromRefreshTokenParameters params = new CreateFromRefreshTokenParameters();
    params.SetScope("openid"); // Optional
    TokenInfo info = new TokenInfo(); // Create TokenInfo object; setting the refresh token
    info.refresh_token = "refreshToken";
    
    info.CreateFromRefreshToken(apiContext, params);

NuGet 2.2 or higher
-------------------
*	NuGet is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework
*   If you develop a library or tool that you want to share with other developers, you create a NuGet package and store the package in a NuGet repository
*   If you want to use a library or tool that someone else has developed, you retrieve the package from the repository and install it in your Visual Studio project or solution
	When you install the package, NuGet copies files to your solution and automatically makes whatever changes are needed, such as adding references and changing your app.config or web.config file
*   If you decide to remove the library, NuGet removes files and reverses whatever changes it made in your project so that no clutter is left
